## Repository structure

Each problem has its own folder which contains the following items:

- *readme.md* - a short description of the problem and its solution

- *solution.c* - the solution implemented in the *C* language.

- *test1.in* - an input file. There could be more than one test files.

- *expected output/test1.out* - the expected output.

## Solution structure

All programs have at least 3 functions:

- *read_from_file*

- *dynamic_programming_computations*

- *write_solution_to_file*

### Major changes

- All vectors are now 0-indexed. In the *Pascal* version, most vectors were indexed from 1. Thus, now all computed and displayed positions start from 0.

## Book's history

This book has a long and complex history which will be told here.

## Special thanks

To **Clara Ionescu** (the owner of the publishing company) for the huge effort invested in preparing this book.

To my sister **Mihaela Oltean** for rewriting the codes from *Pascal* to *C*.
